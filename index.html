            <p>Alexander Stepanovich Popov was a Russian physicist, who was one of the first persons to invent a radio
                receiving device.</p>

            <p>Born 16 March 1859 Turyinskiye Rudniki settlement, Perm Governorate, Russian Empire (present-day Krasnoturyinsk, Sverdlovsk Oblast, Russia)</p>
            <p>Popov's work as a teacher at a Russian naval school led him to explore high frequency electrical phenomena. On May 7, 1895, he presented a paper on a wireless lightning detector he had built that worked via using a coherer to detect radio noise from lightning strikes. This day is celebrated in the Russian Federation as Radio Day.</p>
            <p>In a March 24, 1896 demonstration, he transmitted radio signals 250 meters between different campus buildings in St. Petersburg. His work was based on that of another physicist â€“ Oliver Lodge, and contemporaneous with the work of Guglielmo Marconi.</p>
            <p>His paper on his experiments: "On the relation of metallic powders to electrical oscillations", was published 15 December 1895. He did not apply for a patent for his invention. In July 1895 he installed his receiver and a siphon recorder on the roof of the Institute of Forestry building in St. Petersburg. and was able to detect thunderstorms at a range of 50 km, however he was also aware of its communication potential. His paper, read at the 7 May 1895 meeting, concluded:<br><span>I can express my hope that my apparatus will be applied for signaling at great distances by electric vibrations of high frequency, as soon as there will be invented a more powerful generator of such vibrations.</span></p>
